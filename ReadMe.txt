1. INSTALLATION
Download this project's Unity package 'Alchemist'.
In your own Unity Hub add the package and open it.

2. HOW IT WORKS
This is template of UI trade window in a game about Alchemists.

Here on the desk you can see two parties to a trade. Both have stats table which includes name and money. Both have round avatars and inventory window with items to sell.

Each item in the inventory is represented by a picture, quantity and price for one item. Every item in inventory is a button.If you push it and if the other party has enough money to buy it then item goes to other inventory and money go to previous owner of item.

If there are more than one item of certain type you can buy max number of this item by clicking additional 'max button'.

There also provisional button for add money to player which won't be included in final version.
